2. A straight line in two dimension can be represented with y=mx+c , where y and x are the y and x coordinates of the point on line in two dimension space respectively. m is slope of the line and c is intercept made by the line with y axis. Write a program that: a) Reads from end user using suitable messages : i. Slope m ii. Intercept c iii. Values of x b) Reads from end user using suitable messages: a random point ( xp , yp ) c) Print with suitable message if ( xp, yp ) is on the line y=mx+c
