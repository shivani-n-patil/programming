3. Consider three dimension system. A point in three dimension system is represented as ( x , y , z ) , where x , y and z are the x , y and z coordinates of the point in three dimension space respectively. Write a program that:
 a) Reads from end user using suitable messages :
    i. Point p1 ( x1 , y1 , z1 ) , and
    ii. Point p2 ( x2 , y2 , z2 )
 b) Prints with suitable message all partial derivatives between the points ( p1 , p2 )
