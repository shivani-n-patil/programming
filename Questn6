6. A bigger solid cube is to be built using n number of smaller cubes, having unit length. Write a program that: a) Read n from user with suitable message b) Check if n is valid, that is can a bigger solid cube be build using n number unit length cubes c) Calculate the surface area of bigger cube, s1
d) One unit length cubic block is now removed from every corner of the cube. Calculate the surface area of new structure, s2
e) Prints with suitable message, both surface areas s1 and s2
f) Print what conclusion can be drawn with respect to  s1 and  s2
