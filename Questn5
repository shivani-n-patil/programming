/*
5. The area of a square is d. What is the area of the circle which has the diagonal of the square as its diameter? Write a program that: a) Reads from user: area of a square as d (an integer) b) Check if area entered, d is valid
c) Find the area of the circle whose diameter is the same as the diagonal of the square
d) Find the circumference of the circle whose radius is the same as the diagonal of the square
